## The Details]
- Anti-aliasing
    - Implement Xiaolin Wu's line drawing algorithm. Create additional MDL "aaline" command to draw an anti-aliased line. Bresenham's algorithm will still be used for scanline conversion and zbuffer. Xiaolin Wu's algorithm will be used just to draw lines, not filling polygons.
- Phong shading
    - Implement shading MDL command to toggle between "phong" and "flat" shading models
